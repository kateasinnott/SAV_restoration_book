# Project Introduction
Restoration techniques and community dynamics are not well understood for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). My research addresses the following questions: 
**What planting methods maximize SAV establishment in unvegetated aquatic habitat?**
**Does increasing SAV species richness maximize invasion resistance to non-native invaders?** 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

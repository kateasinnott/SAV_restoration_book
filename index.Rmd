# Project Introduction
Restoration techniques and community dynamics are not well understood for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). ***Data is fabricated for coding practice purposes***

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:  
1. **What planting methods maximize SAV establishment in unvegetated aquatic habitat?**  
2. **Does increasing SAV species richness maximize invasion resistance to non-native invaders?** 

## Project Outline
This book is composed of the following chapters:  
* Chapter 2 -- Database Creation  
* Chapter 3 -- Testing Invasion Resistance Mechanisms in Aquatic Plant Communities  
* Chapter 4 -- Improving Establishment in Aquatic Plant Restoration
